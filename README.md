This repository is merely archived for future work regarding Vulkan API.
The project consists of GLFW and GLM along with Vulkan itself.
It is planned to convert this into a Vulkan 3D renderer with some functionality.

To do list:

- Initiate Vulkan and setup GPU for usage.
- Validation layers to validate Vulkan code.
- Setup and use of Swapchain (swap buffer functionality)
- Create pipeline and shaders in SPIR-V
- Setup a Render Pass and Sub passes
- Create and use command buffer on queue
- Load in vertex and index data (optimization)
- Descriptor sets and Push constants
- Setting up a depth buffer.
- Texture Implementation.
- Multiple subpasses with input attachments.
